the sane curse
of having to choose
a new medium

so out of use
or, the same purse
willing to recurse
obtusely interact

"A flake may fall,
no flock too tall,
in the living gardens of all,
a soul fortuitous
and inquisitive
to press experience
up against a wall,
to foretell a promise,
contemplate the premise
that what may count,
lost until found,
among lost pages,
a reader went through stages
of great strife to find
one who could be just
someone to most but
to someone mostly
the Love of an entire life..."
